    How to Avoid Internet Distractions While Working
  </h1>

  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
    Staying focused at work has become harder than ever with constant notifications, tempting social feeds, and open browser tabs pulling our attention. If you're struggling to concentrate, you’re not alone. But there are smart ways to manage your time online and reclaim your productivity.
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mb-8">
    <li className="text-gray-600">
      Identify your biggest distractions — is it YouTube, Twitter, or endless news scrolling?
    </li>
    <li className="text-gray-600">
      Set dedicated “deep work” hours with no internet access or mute all non-essential apps.
    </li>
    <li className="text-gray-600">
      Use browser extensions that block distracting websites or limit screen time.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
    You don’t have to completely cut off from the digital world — just set boundaries. Even small habits like checking emails only twice a day or using the Pomodoro technique can significantly reduce distractions and improve focus.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Tools That Help You Stay Focused</h2>

  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
    If you're serious about staying productive, there are plenty of tools that make it easier to avoid temptation:
  </p>

  <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
    <li className="text-gray-600">
      <strong>Freedom</strong> – Block access to selected websites across all your devices.
    </li>
    <li className="text-gray-600">
      <strong>Cold Turkey</strong> – Go extreme with scheduled lockdowns of distracting apps or sites.
    </li>
    <li className="text-gray-600">
      <strong>Forest</strong> – Grow a virtual tree by staying off your phone (yes, really).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why Internet Distractions Hurt More Than You Think</h2>

  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
    Every time you switch tabs or peek at your phone, your brain needs time to refocus. Over a day, that adds up to hours of lost deep work. It’s not just about wasted time — it’s about the mental drain of constant task-switching.
  </p>

  <blockquote className="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8 border-l-4 border-gray-300">
    <p className="text-gray-800 italic text-lg leading-relaxed">
      "Focus is the new IQ — in a world full of distractions, the ability to concentrate is what sets you apart."
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
    Getting better at focus is a skill, and like any skill, it takes practice. Start small. Commit to one hour of uninterrupted work each day, and build from there. Your brain will thank you for it.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Try This: A Distraction-Free Work Routine</h2>

  <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
    Begin your day by planning your top three tasks. Mute notifications. Use tools like Notion or Todoist to stay on track. Schedule breaks and reward yourself for staying focused. Simple, repeatable habits build long-term discipline.
